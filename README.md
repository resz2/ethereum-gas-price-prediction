# Motivation
- ETH is a cryptocurrency. It is digital money that is global and decentralized, secured by cryptography. Ethereum is a technology that allows the transaction of the cryptocurrency Ether for a small fee. In Ethereum,  the user should purchase a number of gases for reaching a transaction consensus. Gas Limit restricts the execution time and the memory cost of the transaction. Generally, the higher the gas price, the less time spent on reaching a consensus of the transaction. In a block, transaction gas prices vary greatly, generating a gas price that is reasonable in terms of both the price and the time spent on reaching consensus is of utmost importance. Through this project, we aim to find the lowest reasonable gas price for a block using features influencing it.
